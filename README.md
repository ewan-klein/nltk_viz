Visualisation Support for NLTK
==============================

A scratch-pad for buildng browser-based visualisation tools for NLTK.
My current plan is to use Python to trigger a browser session and build a data file, then use D3.js for the visualization. 
A limitation is that it will probably be hard to get call-backs from Javascript to Python, which will limit the interactivity. 
So it won't work for things like the parser demos.
